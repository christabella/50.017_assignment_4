This assignment doesn't use OpenGL, so the project file is a little different from before. 

If you are using XCode, changing arguments via 
Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme -> Run -> Arguments 
can be quite convenient for this assignment.

The scene data and executable built can be found in the build/Products directory.
